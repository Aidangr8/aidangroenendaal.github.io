Hello! My name is Aidan Groenendaal and I am a Senior at Pennsylvania State University studying Astronomy and Astrophysics. My current research interests include radio SETI and Superluminal Raman Lasers. I am a memeber of the Penn State Center for Extraterrestrial Inteeligence where I work on new techniques to filter RFI by leveraging lunar occultations. Over Summer 2025, I joined Northwestern's Laboratory for Atomic and Photonic Technology (LAPT) as apart of the CIERA REU. Here, I worked on optimizing the laser output of a superluminal laser which has been shown to be extremely sensitive to cavity perturbations.
