Over the summer, I had the oppurtunity to join Northwestern's Laboratory for Atomic and Photonic Technology (LAPT). For almost 20 years, work has been ongoing into creating extremely sensitivie ring laser gyrocopes. Instruments that can be used in meterology, navigation, astrophysics, and many other fields. My research focused on how to optimize the output of such a laser.
